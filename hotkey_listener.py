"""Dell G15 dedicated G-key listener - toggles Game Mode.

On the G15 5515 the dedicated key emits evdev keycode KEY_PERFORMANCE (701)
on the "AT Translated Set 2 keyboard" device - a distinct, purpose-built
Linux keycode, not aliased to anything else. Which physical action produces
it depends on Fn Lock:

    Fn Lock OFF : a bare tap of the key            -> KEY_PERFORMANCE
    Fn Lock ON  : a bare tap                       -> KEY_F9 (plain F9)
                  Fn + F9                          -> KEY_PERFORMANCE

This listener only ever acts on KEY_PERFORMANCE, so it can never hijack a
real F9 press. Default behaviour mirrors Windows: **one press toggles
G-Mode** (the "performance" platform_profile - on the G15 the firmware ramps
the fan curve and raises the CPU/GPU power limits; balanced turns it back
off). If you find a bare tap too easy to hit by accident, set
TUXTHROTTLE_HOTKEY_MODE=double for a double-tap trigger (two KEY_PERFORMANCE
within TUXTHROTTLE_HOTKEY_DOUBLE_MS - a long-press can't be used because
KEY_PERFORMANCE fires as an instantaneous down+up).

Runs as a systemd --user service (installed by the HotkeyListener tweak).
Needs python3-evdev and 'input' group membership. The toggle re-uses
sensors.toggle_game_mode_external(), which tries passwordless sudo first
(PasswordlessGameModeToggle tweak) and falls back to a GUI pkexec prompt.
